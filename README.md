# TMUber

This project was completed as an assignment for the CPS209 course at Toronto Metropolitan University

TMUber is a simplified simulation of an Uber-like application for rides and deliveries, implemented as a command-line interface application. The project is designed to handle users and drivers, manage service requests, and simulate various actions typically associated with a ride-hailing and delivery service.

To compile use javac TMUberUI.java and to run use java TMUberUI. 

Please view TMUberUI.java to see appropriate commands. 

For this simulation the city consists of a grid of 9 X 9 City Blocks. Streets are east-west (1st street to 9th street). Avenues are north-south (1st avenue to 9th avenue). An example of a valid address  is "34 4th Street" or "34 4th Avenue".
